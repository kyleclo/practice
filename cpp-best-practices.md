#### Pointers
- When to use pointers:
    - alternative way to iterate through arrays
    - dynamically allocate memory
    - pass large data to functions without copying
    - pass function to another function
    - achieve polymorphism through inheritance
    - data structures (e.g. linked lists, trees)

- When declaring pointer variables, put asterisk next to variable name

```{c++}
int *intPtr1, *intPtr2;
```

- When declaring functions returning pointers, put asterisk next to type

```{c++}
int* doSomething();
```
